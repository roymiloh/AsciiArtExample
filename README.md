# AsciiArtExample

An example case for [AsciiArt](https://github.com/roymiloh/AsciiArt) 

Read from an input file (located in `data` folder) and write to output file.<br />
As the read and write actions are concurrent, they can run in parallel easily.<br />
There's also an example for throttling (using channels) for sane memory consumption.
